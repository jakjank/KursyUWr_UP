why second word splitting is needed?

FILES=$(ls *.txt)  # Command substitution
for file in $FILES; do  # Word splitting happens here
    echo "Processing $file"
done
(with file1.txt and file2.txt)

without second word splitting FILE would be "file1.txt file2.txt"

before var subst.
files="file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt"
rm $files
would try to rm "file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt"

before instr. subst - 1. example
